![tests](https://github.com/minimav/plotly_football_pitch/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

This repo contains code to plot football pitches using `plotly`. Currently only horizontal pitches are supported, with the origin located at the bottom left
corner of the pitch.

## Examples

Further examples can be found in `examples/pitch.ipynb`.

```python
from plotly_football_pitch import make_pitch_figure, PitchDimensions


dimensions = PitchDimensions()
fig = make_pitch_figure(dimensions)
fig.show()
```

![basic pitch](https://github.com/minimav/plotly-football-pitch/blob/main/images/basic_pitch.png?raw=True)

```python
from plotly_football_pitch import (
    make_pitch_figure,
    PitchDimensions,
    SingleColourBackground
)


dimensions = PitchDimensions()
fig = make_pitch_figure(
    dimensions,
    pitch_background=SingleColourBackground("#81B622"),
)
fig.show()
```

![green pitch](https://github.com/minimav/plotly-football-pitch/blob/main/images/green_pitch.png?raw=True)

```python
import numpy as np

from plotly_football_pitch import make_pitch_figure, PitchDimensions


dimensions = PitchDimensions()
fig = make_pitch_figure(dimensions)

# define number of grid squares for heatmap data
width_grid = 12
length_grid = 15

data = np.array([
    [random.random() for _ in range(length_grid)]
    for _ in range(width_grid)
])

fig = add_heatmap(fig, data)
fig.show()
```
